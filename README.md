# P3 - my solution to the 2nd competition in evolutionary computation at WUST
This repository contains my adaptation/implementation of the Parameter-less population pyramid (P3) optimization method. It is my solution to the second evolutionary computation challenge, organized at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## The method
The method was published by Brian W. Goldman et al. in [this](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2576768.2598350) paper. If you're interested in how the method works, go check it out. If you'd like to know how the authors implemented it, multiple versions are available [on Mr Goldman's GitHub profile](https://github.com/brianwgoldman?tab=repositories).
